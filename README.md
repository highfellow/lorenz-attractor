lorenz-attractor
================

An interactive web based demonstration of the Lorenz chaotic attractor.

You need to install the flot jquery graphing plugin under 'flot/' for this code to work. See: http://www.flotcharts.org/ . You also need to install jquery-ui to 'jquery-ui/'. See: http://jqueryui.com/

Having done this, you just need to copy to a directory inside your web root, and set the file permissions right for your system.

See LICENSE for Licensing. Roughly you can do what you like with it as long as you credit me and don't expect it to work for any serious purpose.
